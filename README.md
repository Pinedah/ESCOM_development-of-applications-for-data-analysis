# Development of Applications for Data Analysis

## Course Information

- **Institution:** Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN)
- **Academic Program:** Bachelor’s in Data Science
- **Semester:** IV
- **Credits:** 7.5 (Tepic), 6.1 (SATCA)
- **Unit Type:** Theoretical-Practical / Mandatory
- **Course Duration:** 81 hours (54 hours of theory, 27 hours of practice)

## Course Purpose

The course is designed to develop skills in creating data analysis applications, starting from data acquisition, preprocessing, and knowledge extraction. It focuses on practical use of Python for data manipulation and machine learning.

## Course Content

### 1. Python Programming
- Basic concepts of Python
- Standard data types
- Control structures
- Functions
- Object-oriented programming with Python

### 2. Data Acquisition and Storage
- Structured and semi-structured data (CSV, TSV, HDF5, Excel, JSON, XML)
- Relational and NoSQL databases
- Python libraries for data structuring (NumPy, Pandas, SciPy)
- Web scraping (Requests, BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium)
- Data collection from social networks and geolocation sources
- Data preprocessing (cleaning, missing data handling, transformation, etc.)

### 3. Machine Learning
- Supervised learning with scikit-learn (classification, regression)
- Unsupervised learning with scikit-learn (clustering)
- Distributed processing with Apache Spark (Resilient Distributed Datasets, SparkSQL, SparkMLlib)

## Learning Strategies

- **Problem-based learning:** Students will solve real-world problems through programming tasks.
- **Project-based learning:** Team projects are required, applying the knowledge in real-case scenarios.
- **Case studies:** Focused discussions on specific data problems and their solutions.

## Evaluation

- **Diagnostic assessment:** Evaluation of prior knowledge.
- **Portfolio of evidence:** Includes mind maps, programming exercises, problem solutions, case reports, and practice reports.
- **Project reports:** Students will submit reports documenting the development of their data analysis applications using Python.
